Have your ingredients but don’t know what to cook? or looking to discover a new recipe based on your ingredients?

I gotchu,

I made a website solely for that reason.

What this website does is give you three recipes based on the ingredients you input.

Why did I make this?

I was inspired by Shou Chew, TikTok’s CEO, vision to give people a platform to be discovered and change their lives. One of the great examples of this is Khaby. Khaby, who is from Senegal, moved to Italy and worked there as a factory worker. Before TikTok, Khaby was a nobody, but now Khabi has over 160 million followers on the platform and has completely changed his life. And for me, it was inspiring.

But my way of “discovery” is different from TikTok; I do this through food. What do I mean by that?
As the saying goes, “The way to a person’s heart is through his or her stomach." And I do believe that.
People who cook for their families, friends, and loved ones know how fulfilling it is when people love the food. And I want to achieve that through this website.
A business owner who cooks for a living could also benefit from this.

By “discovering” new recipes based on the ingredients you have. People who cook could give new experiences to people, whether it be their customers, their families, their friends, or their loved ones, and in that way they could earn their hearts. Again, as the saying goes, “The way to a person’s heart is through his or her stomach.”.

But for now, the website is in its MVP phase (prototype). Aesthetically, there is still a lot of room for improvement, as I am the only one (for now) building this during my free time. I will try to add new features soon. I want to reach as many people as possible. And if anybody wants to be a part of this, feel free to pm me, or if you have feedback, also kindly pm me.

The website consists of a textbox, a submit button, three different categories of ingredients, and three images of the recipes.
First is the textbox; this is where you will input your ingredients, separated by a comma (,) or a space ().

Second is the submit button, which you click on after you enter your ingredients.
Three different results will be shown; each will have an image and a title for that recipe.

Third is the category. There are 3 different ingredient categories: first, Missed Ingredients, which are the ingredient(s) of the recipe that you have not entered in the textbox; second, Used Ingredients, which are the ingredient(s) of the recipe that you have entered in the textbox; and third, Unused Ingredients, which are the ingredient(s) that you have entered in the textbox that are not part of the recipe.
